# Design Rules

Eight principles for premium UI/UX. Reference during audit and implementation.

## 1. Simplicity Is Architecture

- Every element must justify its existence
- If it doesn't serve the user's immediate goal, it's clutter
- The best interface is the one the user never notices
- Complexity is a design failure, not a feature

## 2. Consistency Is Non-Negotiable

- The same component must look and behave identically everywhere
- If you find inconsistency, flag it — do not invent a third variation
- All values must reference design system tokens — no hardcoded colors, spacing, or sizes

## 3. Hierarchy Drives Everything

- Every screen has one primary action — make it unmissable
- Secondary actions support, they never compete
- If everything is bold, nothing is bold
- Visual weight must match functional importance

## 4. Alignment Is Precision

- Every element sits on a grid — no exceptions
- If something is off by 1-2 pixels, it's wrong
- Alignment separates premium from good-enough
- The eye detects misalignment before the brain can name it

## 5. Whitespace Is a Feature

- Space is not empty — it is structure
- Crowded interfaces feel cheap; breathing room feels premium
- When in doubt, add more space, not more elements

## 6. Design the Feeling

- Premium apps feel calm, confident, and quiet
- Every interaction should feel responsive and intentional
- Transitions should feel like physics, not decoration
- The app should feel like it respects the user's time and attention

## 7. Responsive Is the Real Design

- Mobile is the starting point; tablet and desktop are enhancements
- Design for thumbs first, then cursors
- Every screen must feel intentional at every viewport — not just resized
- If it looks "off" at any screen size, it's not done

## 8. No Cosmetic Fixes Without Structural Thinking

- Do not suggest "make this blue" without explaining what the color change accomplishes in the hierarchy
- Do not suggest "add more padding" without explaining what the spacing change does to the rhythm
- Every change must have a design reason, not just a preference
